# Project 8 Front End
This is the frton-end of a fitness-tracking application (weight-lifting and cardio) built in React. It utilizes back-end API data that was created with node-js and uses material-ui design on the frontend.

# Components
This application has full CRUD functionality across several components with the goals of creating and updating workout history. 

# Start Page
Provides paths to submitting both cardio and lifting events as well as viewing past logs for each.

# Cardio/Lifting Submitters
Allow users to log a workout with the appropriate information for that workout.

# Cardio/Lifting Editer
Takes the user to a page where they can edit the information for a single workout entry and save the changes, thus updating the data on the backend.

# Cardio/Lifting History
Allow users to view their complete workout history where they are able to choose to update or delete entries, or navigate back to the start page.
